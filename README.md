# LittleJS
The Tiny JavaScript Game Engine That Can!

## Examples

### [Hello World](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/) - Starter project
### [Breakout](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/examples/breakout) - Simple breakout style game
### [Platformer](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/examples/platformer) - Complex platformer with procedural levels and destruction
### [Stress Test](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/examples/stress) - Max load test, target is ~50,000 at 60 fps in chrome, about half that on Firefox

Also check out my game ["Space Huggers"](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/SpaceHuggers) an run and gun roguelike that I am building with this game engine.

this is a work in progress. Very close to being done, still worning on a few things before offical release.

todo
- puzzle game demo (tetris)
- add enemies to platformer demo
- more code cleanup
- hook up automatic documentaiton system
