# ![LittleJS Logo](favicon.png) LittleJS - The Tiny JavaScript Game Engine That Can

## All aboard!

LittleJS is a super lightweight JavaScript game engine with a fast hybrid rendering system. It provides everything necessary to make amazing games, including rendering, physics, particles, sound effects, music, input handling, and debug tools. LittleJS is designed to be extremely small yet powerful enough for a variety of applications, from game jams to commercial releases. The code is very well documented with a variety of examples to get you started. Choo-Choo! ðŸš‚
